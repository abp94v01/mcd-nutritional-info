# mcd-nutritional-info
Organising the data from the McDonald's nutritional info menu.

I am using my knowledge of python from dataquest.io to manipulate the data in the menu. The full menu (imported by Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/mcdonalds/nutrition-facts) includes the a comprehensive list of all the food items available by mcdonald's and their nutrional information such as fat content, protein, sugar etc.
As I am a beginner I have stripped the CSV file down to 3 columns: category, item and calories.
I have imported the file into a python script to manipulate the data. 

I am currently stuck at converting the calories list to integers.
